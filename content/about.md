Hello, nice that you are interested in me! I am a 30 something DevOps engineer who loves to play and create games. I'm programming Python for work C# for my games. I have a soft spot for 'old' programming languages like Lisp and Smalltalk, and play around with Pharo and Clojure. 

I am a father of a 20 month old twins (Boy & Girl) so I have limited free time to tinker in. I like to read and play the guitar or play with an Arduino or Raspberry PI.
