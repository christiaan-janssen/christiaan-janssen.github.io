Last week it was Unity week over at <a href="https://www.packtpub.com/" target="_blank">Packt Publishing</a>. They have this great free ebook program where you can get a new random ebook every day. This has allowed my ebook collection to grow to over 270 ebooks. Every so often they have a theme week where you get ebooks that fit the topic. I now own 17 ebooks about Unity so I thought it was time to start doing something with them. With the school holiday around the corner I have some more time to actually read some books for myself. So if I cut down on the gaming a bit, I might be able to actually make something!

I worked through the first 3 chapters of <a href="https://www.packtpub.com/game-development/mastering-unity-2d-game-development" target="_blank">Mastering Unity 2D Game Development</a>Â and it was interesting tho maybe a bit to basic for me. For now I have a simple Player animation, a background and a moving camera.
