<h3>We're live! Nice.</h3>
I have great plans for this site! "But will they all happen Chris?" I hear you ask. Well, to be honest, I have no idea. I can be a real slacker when it comes to things like plans. And on top of that I have new plans every week.

For now, I'm back to running <a href="http://www.ghost.org">Ghost</a> with Apache to use as a blogging platform. I think it is an excellent platform for me at the moment. A nice minimal design and a light weight application. Coupled with a split-screen Markdown editor to write your posts in.
