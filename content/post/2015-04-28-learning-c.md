title: Learning C#

Over the last couple of weeks, I have been learning how to program in C#. I'm following a course over at <a href="http://www.edx.org">edx.org</a> that is given by Microsoft. In the past I have been looking at C# a number of times, as it is a nice medium between C and Java. Following this course has brought back a lot of the stuff I was taught in school about programming, but we were learning Java back then.
<h4>But why C#?</h4>
I'm looking into C# as it is the defacto language to program in if you want to work with <a href="http://www.unity3d.com">Unity</a>, and it is very cross-platform these days thanks to the <a href="http://www.mono-project.com/">Mono Project</a>. Microsoft is also working on some <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/dotnet">Open source</a> stuff for the .Net framework.
<h4>Xamarin</h4>
One more thing I would like to show you is <a href="http://xamarin.com/">Xamarin</a>, a cross platform system to write apps for Android and Osx in C#. This is another major reason for me to try to learn C# as it would allow my to write apps in on language and release it on all major platforms.
