Today I made a small update to the site. After trying to find a nice theme, I settle on the <a href="https://github.com/dlecina/StayPuft">StayPuft theme</a>. I already made some small changes, reducing the posts on the front page to maximum a 100 words with a read more link, and I'm looking into changing the colour and layout of the page. The other change is that I integrated <a href="https://disqus.com/">Disqus</a> comments into the site so you can start to give me some feedback! :-)

Thats all for now, I have still a lot of work in our new house, so I will have to see if I have time to do some programming in the next couple of days.
