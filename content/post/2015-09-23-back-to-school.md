On the first of this month I started school again. I started an Associates Degree ICT Management. It is a part-time study next to my day job. I spend one day in school, from 13:00 till 22:00, and 4 days in work. Next to that we get a lot of homework.

The subjects for now are all very interesting:
- Python
- Cloud Computing
- Cisco
- ITIL

ITIL is a quite dry subject, but its giving me a lot of insight into the processes at work.

Next to the 10+ hours of homework I'm still trying to do some programming of my own, but thats an subject for another post. Its a bit strange to be in school again, but it's also very nice to be studying again.
