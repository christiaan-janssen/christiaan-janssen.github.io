<p> Lately I have been working more in emacs, trying to see what I can do with it. The keyboard shortcuts are a bit arcane, but when you get used to them it' actualy fun to work with. This post for instance is written in emacs on my laptop. </p>

<p> I have already setup my email with <a href="https://notmuchmail.org/">notmuch</a> and <a href="http://www.offlineimap.org/">offlineimap</a>. This allows me to read and write mail in emacs. And the next thing I'm working in is to learn to use <a href="http://www.offlineimap.org/">org-mode</a> with <a href="https://github.com/punchagan/org2blog">org2blog</a>. Org2Blog is an addon to erg-mode, a emacs major-mode that help organise your life. It can handel to do lists, write documents, handle you agenda and morep. </p>
