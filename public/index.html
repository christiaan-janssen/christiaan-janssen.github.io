  <p class="post-summary">I have been using Emacs for some time now, and it has been interesting, but there are some things that make it a bit difficult to use. The key bindings for instance are at times really weird and impossible to guess. Some things are hard to get to work, and with others I run into some limitations with Emacs. Nevertheless it is an interesting editor to work with. It was fun to tell an external engineer that I use Emacs when he was asking about the editor I used, and seeing his reaction.</p>

  <p class="post-summary">Lately I have been working more in emacs, trying to see what I can do with it. The keyboard shortcuts are a bit arcane, but when you get used to them it&#39; actualy fun to work with. This post for instance is written in emacs on my laptop.  I have already setup my email with notmuch and offlineimap. This allows me to read and write mail in emacs. And the next thing I&#39;m working in is to learn to use org-mode with org2blog.</p>

  <p class="post-summary">Last week it was Unity week over at Packt Publishing. They have this great free ebook program where you can get a new random ebook every day. This has allowed my ebook collection to grow to over 270 ebooks. Every so often they have a theme week where you get ebooks that fit the topic. I now own 17 ebooks about Unity so I thought it was time to start doing something with them.</p>

  <p class="post-summary">Great news every one! The twins are born! Our family is expanded with 2 healthy baby’s! I can tell you that it is the best thing that has happened to me together with my wedding.
 
 
Needles to say they need a lot of attention, so next to school and work I don’t have a lot of time left to do other things. I’m still working on a few things that I hope to tell about soon.</p>

  <p class="post-summary">On the first of this month I started school again. I started an Associates Degree ICT Management. It is a part-time study next to my day job. I spend one day in school, from 13:00 till 22:00, and 4 days in work. Next to that we get a lot of homework.
The subjects for now are all very interesting: - Python - Cloud Computing - Cisco - ITIL
ITIL is a quite dry subject, but its giving me a lot of insight into the processes at work.</p>

  <p class="post-summary">Time fly’s when your having fun! Its been over 2 months since I made a post, not really what I was planning on. It’s not like I’m having writers block, I just haven’t found the time to write. Between work and the house and me being lazy I’m just to busy =) The current programming language Drum roll… is JavaScript! As posted before, I’m trying to make an App for my wife.</p>

  <p class="post-summary">Last week I finished my edx.org course C# programming from Microsoft. It was a fun course, and it showed me that programming is a bit like riding a bike. Once I was going, it all was very familiar. Its not so strange I guess, all the Object Oriented Programming ideas are the same for any language, C# or Java (I learned Java in school).
The course itself was given on the edx platform, but it was one of the first MOOC’s Microsoft gave.</p>

  <p class="post-summary">Today I decided DrunkTurtle needed to move. I liked the simplicity of Ghost, but I was missing some things. It were small things, but things I wanted non the less. So, now were running on Wordpress :)</p>

  <p class="post-summary">Over the last couple of weeks, I have been learning how to program in C#. I’m following a course over at edx.org that is given by Microsoft. In the past I have been looking at C# a number of times, as it is a nice medium between C and Java. Following this course has brought back a lot of the stuff I was taught in school about programming, but we were learning Java back then.</p>

  <p class="post-summary">Today I made a small update to the site. After trying to find a nice theme, I settle on the StayPuft theme. I already made some small changes, reducing the posts on the front page to maximum a 100 words with a read more link, and I’m looking into changing the colour and layout of the page. The other change is that I integrated Disqus comments into the site so you can start to give me some feedback!</p>
