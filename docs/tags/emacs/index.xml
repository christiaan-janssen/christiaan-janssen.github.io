      <description>I have been using Emacs for some time now, and it has been interesting, but there are some things that make it a bit difficult to use. The key bindings for instance are at times really weird and impossible to guess. Some things are hard to get to work, and with others I run into some limitations with Emacs. Nevertheless it is an interesting editor to work with. It was fun to tell an external engineer that I use Emacs when he was asking about the editor I used, and seeing his reaction.</description>

      <description>Lately I have been working more in emacs, trying to see what I can do with it. The keyboard shortcuts are a bit arcane, but when you get used to them it&#39; actualy fun to work with. This post for instance is written in emacs on my laptop.  I have already setup my email with notmuch and offlineimap. This allows me to read and write mail in emacs. And the next thing I&#39;m working in is to learn to use org-mode with org2blog.</description>
