      <description>Great news every one! The twins are born! Our family is expanded with 2 healthy baby&amp;rsquo;s! I can tell you that it is the best thing that has happened to me together with my wedding.
&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;
Needles to say they need a lot of attention, so next to school and work I don&amp;rsquo;t have a lot of time left to do other things. I&amp;rsquo;m still working on a few things that I hope to tell about soon.</description>

      <description>On the first of this month I started school again. I started an Associates Degree ICT Management. It is a part-time study next to my day job. I spend one day in school, from 13:00 till 22:00, and 4 days in work. Next to that we get a lot of homework.
The subjects for now are all very interesting: - Python - Cloud Computing - Cisco - ITIL
ITIL is a quite dry subject, but its giving me a lot of insight into the processes at work.</description>

      <description>Time fly&amp;rsquo;s when your having fun! Its been over 2 months since I made a post, not really what I was planning on. It&amp;rsquo;s not like I&amp;rsquo;m having writers block, I just haven&amp;rsquo;t found the time to write. Between work and the house and me being lazy I&amp;rsquo;m just to busy =) The current programming language Drum roll&amp;hellip; is JavaScript! As posted before, I&amp;rsquo;m trying to make an App for my wife.</description>

      <title>C# Programming</title>

      <description>Last week I finished my edx.org course C# programming from Microsoft. It was a fun course, and it showed me that programming is a bit like riding a bike. Once I was going, it all was very familiar. Its not so strange I guess, all the Object Oriented Programming ideas are the same for any language, C# or Java (I learned Java in school).
The course itself was given on the edx platform, but it was one of the first MOOC&amp;rsquo;s Microsoft gave.</description>

      <description>Today I decided DrunkTurtle needed to move. I liked the simplicity of Ghost, but I was missing some things. It were small things, but things I wanted non the less. So, now were running on Wordpress :)</description>

      <title>Learning C#</title>

      <description>Over the last couple of weeks, I have been learning how to program in C#. I&amp;rsquo;m following a course over at edx.org that is given by Microsoft. In the past I have been looking at C# a number of times, as it is a nice medium between C and Java. Following this course has brought back a lot of the stuff I was taught in school about programming, but we were learning Java back then.</description>

      <title>Small update</title>

      <description>Today I made a small update to the site. After trying to find a nice theme, I settle on the StayPuft theme. I already made some small changes, reducing the posts on the front page to maximum a 100 words with a read more link, and I&amp;rsquo;m looking into changing the colour and layout of the page. The other change is that I integrated Disqus comments into the site so you can start to give me some feedback!</description>

      <title>Asus T100 and Linux</title>

      <description>For some time now I own a Asus T100 Laptop. It&amp;rsquo;s a nice and small machine running Windows 8. After having used it for a couple of months with Windows 8 (and 8.1) it works good. I don&amp;rsquo;t have a lot of problems with the Metro interface, as it still supports my workflow without any problems. I honestly think that this is the longest I have had a device running it&amp;rsquo;s stock software since my Windows XP machine.</description>
